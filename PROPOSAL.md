I would like to create an interactive scientific app that can graphically 
display astronomical information from the Neowise Near-Earth-Object dataset.
This is essentially a significant expansion to the JSON assingment we did in 
week 2. In addition to performing data analysis on the set, I will graphically
represent this data and make it available to the user in the form of a cinder
application.

I am fairly familiar with the dataset as I used it in Week2. When we first
worked with the JSON data, I immediately envisioned a concept of a web app
with interactive graphs and tools that users could use to compare different 
aspects of the dataset (inclination, distance to earth, etc.). I hope to 
implement this vision thorugh this project.

As a rough time goal, I plan to spend week 1 on ingesting the JSON data, Week 
2 on data analysis, and Week 3 on graphics. My main stretch goal would be to 
make this app compatible with other scientific datasets.
